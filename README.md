🔎 What This Tells Us:
The frontend is React-based, using component-driven design.

Files are cleanly separated by user roles, making maintenance easier.

admin/ folder is filled out — suggests admin interface is most developed.

Images/ can be used for banners, logos, or guide illustrations.

Lacks routing (react-router-dom) and API handling files — could be in-progress or omitted in screenshot.

🔍 Observations:
This is a Node.js/Express backend, likely using MongoDB via Mongoose.

Schema.js suggests a central location for user, complaint, or message models.

index.js likely defines:

Express routes

Middleware for parsing JSON

Connection to MongoDB (via config.js)

CORS and maybe JWT authentication

Clean and minimal — good for scaling.

✅ Suggestions for Enhancement
🔐 Security:
Use JWT or OAuth for secure authentication.

Store passwords using bcrypt.

Ensure proper validation/sanitization of complaint input.

💬 Messaging System:
Integrate Socket.IO for real-time chat.

Enable file uploads in messages if needed (via multer).

🧭 Routing and Navigation:
Add react-router-dom for frontend routing:

/admin

/agent

/user-dashboard

/login, /register

📊 Admin Dashboard:
Use charts (e.g., Chart.js or Recharts) to show:

Complaints per category

Resolved vs unresolved

Agent performance

🧪 Testing:
Backend: Add Mocha/Chai or Jest for API testing.

Frontend: Use React Testing Library.

🔄 API & State Management:
Integrate Redux or React Context API for managing logged-in user sessions and complaint state.

Use Axios or Fetch API for handling HTTP calls.
